# Inspire IT Solutions – Networking Project

## 📘 Project Overview
**Inspire IT Solutions** is a networking project designed to build a reliable and scalable network infrastructure for multiple office branches across **Bangladesh**.  
The project focuses on establishing secure, efficient, and interconnected communication between offices to ensure seamless data flow and centralized management.

---

## 🌐 Objectives
- Design a structured network topology for multiple offices.  
- Implement inter-office connectivity using routers, switches, and end devices.  
- Ensure secure communication through proper addressing and configuration.  
- Demonstrate network scalability and fault tolerance.
